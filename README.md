Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for the equity percentage feature in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner may optionally start prompting from here for testing iteration.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
